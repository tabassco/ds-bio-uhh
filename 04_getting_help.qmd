## The Internet

There are multiple ways to search for help:
* [Google](https://google.com)
* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
* R Blogs (usually found via Google)

Use Stackoverflow examples with caution, but as long as you're only scripting and it has the intended effect you should be fine!
