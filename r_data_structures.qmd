# R Basics

## Data Structures

### Atomics

* double / float
```r
x <- 1
typeof(x)
print(x)
```

* integer
```r
x <- 1L
typeof(x)
print(x)
```

* logical
```r
x <- TRUE
typeof(x)
print(x)
```

* character
```r
x <- "Hello"
typeof(x)
print(x)
```

### Vectors
* always flat
* always identical data type for each value
 -> If they are not equal they will be coerced.
 
```r
vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
print(vector)
```

* can be created with multiple vectors
```r
vector <- c(1, 2, 3, c(1, 2, 3))
print(vector)
```
